# Introduction
Pharmacy Management System aims to help in maintaining and managing the records for a pharmaceutical store by improving efficiency, accuracy and security. Pharmacies need to maintain details of medicine stock, suppliers, employees, customers, any 
stock purchased by the pharmacy and any sales made by the pharmacy. The previous manual methods required the pharmacists to manually monitor all the records lists and transactions and to verify the presence of each drug in the pharmacy. Searching for any required drug may be difficult. Using the Pharmacy Management System, one can maintain stock and inventory, oversee transactions, manage suppliers and employees and maintain records of its customers. The system will help prevent waste of time and resources, allow easy access to medicines, as well 
as ensure more security and reliability for the data compared to the manual systems. The system assists the pharmacy in handling the daily requirements in a smoother, better and effective manner.
